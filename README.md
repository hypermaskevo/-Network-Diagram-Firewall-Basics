This project is based on the Day 1 lab exercise for Cisco Packet Tracer practice. It demonstrates a simple but structured enterprise network with two locations (New York and Tokyo) connected via the Internet, using routers, switches, firewalls, and endpoints. It also introduces the concept of external threats with an 'Attacker' laptop.
